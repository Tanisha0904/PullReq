However we should not keep this hack forever.\r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/grafana/grafana/pull/66187\r\n\r\n\r\n# Release notice breaking change\r\n\r\nThe Vector interface that was deprecated in Grafana 10 has been removed in Grafana 11.  Rather than use an interface, with get/set function, you can simply use an Array.  Plugins compiled against older versions and depend on calling get/set will continue to work because the Array prototype still has a modified prototype.  This will be removed in the future\r\n",

        "body": "**What is this feature?**\r\n\r\nUpdates Grafana Alertmanager to work with new interface from https://github.com/grafana/alerting/pull/161. This change stops passing user-defined templates to the Grafana Alertmanager by persisting them to disk and instead passes them by string.\r\n\r\n**Why do we need this feature?**\r\n\r\nThis PR is a general improvement and simplification, but there are also some specific reasons why we might want to do this:\r\n\r\n- Incremental step towards abstracting data layer for Grafana's Alertmanager interface away from needing disk-based storage. Next step would likely focus on `FileStore`.\r\n- Reduces likelihood of consistency complexities on save/apply, especially in the context of future Remote AM work.\r\n- Since `DefaultTemplateString` is now treated like other defaults and therefore consistently applied first. User-defined templates can now rely on being able to always override defaults.\r\n\r\n**Who is this feature for?**\r\n\r\nDevelopers mostly, though alert users wanting to consistently override default templates will see improvement here.\r\n\r\n**Which issue(s) does this PR fix?**:\r\n\r\nFixes #76476\r\n\r\n**Special notes for your reviewer:**\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/grafana/alerting/pull/161 needs to be merged first and the change to go.mod updated with the new ref.\r\n- I chose not to remove `Config.Templates` entirely. We should no longer be using it anywhere in local Grafana AM but it's still possible external AMs could use the filenames somehow. We should make a decision one way or the other eventually, but for now keeping it is the safe bet.\r\n- We used to rely on the disk-persisted templates to decide when a template had changed and update the AM config accordingly. This is no longer possible, so instead we replace the hash of `PostableApiAlertingConfig` with the hash of `PostableUserConfig`, which includes the template contents. This change also necessitates we modify `GetStatus` to expect `PostableUserConfig` as the config.\r\n\r\n",

If the Pull Request is a work in progress, make use of GitHub's \"Draft PR\" feature and mark it as such.\r\n\r\n5. If you can not merge your Pull Request due to a merge conflict, Rebase it.

The PR title is used to auto-generate the changelog for issues marked with the \"add to changelog\" label.\r\n\r\n7. If your PR content should be added to the What's New document for the next major or minor release, add the **add to what's new** label to your PR.

If this is your first time, please read our contribution guide at https://github.com/grafana/grafana/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n\r\n2. Ensure you include and run the appropriate tests as part of your Pull Request.\r\n\r\n3. In a new feature or configuration option, an update to the documentation is necessary. Everything related to the documentation is under the docs folder in the root of the repository.\r\n\r\n4. If the Pull Request is a work in progress, make use of GitHub's \"Draft PR\" feature and mark it as such.\r\n\r\n5. If you can not merge your Pull Request due to a merge conflict, Rebase it. This gets it in sync with the main branch.\r\n\r\n6. Name your PR as \"<FeatureArea>: Describe your change\", e.g. Alerting: Prevent race condition. If it's a fix or feature relevant for the changelog describe the user impact in the title. The PR title is used to auto-generate the changelog for issues marked with the \"add to changelog\" label.\r\n\r\n7. If your PR content should be added to the What's New document for the next major or minor release, add the **add to what's new** label to your PR. Note that you should add this label to the main PR that introduces the feature; do not add this label to smaller PRs for the feature.\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n**What is this feature?**\r\n\r\nLargely through an update on the scenes library,\r\n\r\nImproves the behavior of the label filter:\r\n- Includes a label to clarify the meaning of the \"+\" button\r\n  - https://github.com/grafana/scenes/pull/619\r\n- The label selector and value selector now automatically open in a clear workflow\r\n  - https://github.com/grafana/scenes/pull/614\r\n- Also: https://github.com/grafana/scenes/pull/620\r\n\r\n\r\n- Fixes #82484\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/grafana/grafana/assets/38694490/d7561d9b-234d-43be-8c20-c2dd603cd438)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Special notes for your reviewer:**\r\n\r\nPlease check that:\r\n- [ ] It works as expected from a user's perspective.\r\n- [ ] If this is a pre-GA feature, it is behind a feature toggle.\r\n- [ ] The docs are updated, and if this is a [notable improvement](https://grafana.com/docs/writers-toolkit/writing-guide/contribute-release-notes/#how-to-determine-if-content-belongs-in-a-whats-new-document), it's added to our [What's New](https://grafana.com/docs/writers-toolkit/writing-guide/contribute-release-notes/) doc.\r\n",
